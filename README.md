# PPSO_with_CEC_2017
The implementation of PPSO.


1. Type the following command to compile the program:

   make

2. Type either one of the following two commands to run the program:

  ./PPSO

  or
  
  ./PPSO [Runs] [Population] [Dimensions] [Testing_Function] [MAX_NFEs]



This Algorithm is from Proactive Particles in Swarm Optimization: a Settings-Free Algorithm for Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization Problems in 2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)

And the implementation is evaluated the performance of PPSO on the CEC 2017 - Benchmark Function.

These Function are from Problem Definitions and Evaluation Criteria for the CEC 2017 Special Session and Competition on Single Objective Real-Parameter Numerical Optimization.


Final the cec17_test_func.cc is from the github (https://github.com/lacerdamarcelo/cec17_python)
