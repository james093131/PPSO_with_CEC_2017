# PPSO_with_CEC_2021
The implementation of PPSO.


1. Type the following command to compile the program:

   make

2. Type either one of the following two commands to run the program:

  ./PPSO

  or
  
  ./PPSO [Runs] [Population] [Dimensions] [Testing_Function] [MAX_NFEs]



This Algorithm is from Proactive Particles in Swarm Optimization: a Settings-Free Algorithm for Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization Problems in 2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)

And the implementation is evaluated the performance of PPSO on the CEC 2021 - Single Objective Bound Constrained Numerical Optimization.

These Function are from Problem Definitions and Evaluation Criteria for the CEC 2021 Special Session and Competition on Single Objective Bound Constrained Numerical Optimization.


Final the cec21_test_func.cpp is from the github (https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan/2021-SO-BCO)
